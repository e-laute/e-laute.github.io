### News: MEI & TEI

**We are editing 1700 pages of tablature music**, searching for concordances and preparing synoptic views. Together with TabMEI Group and Laurent Pugin (Verovio) we are preparing the new version of MEI with lute tablatures (MEI 5.1.).

- We evelop and finalise our **editing / encoding workflows**.

Here is a simplified schematic overview of our encoding workflow, the way to MEI files, which we are editing and will soon make available to everyone: we entered music into Fronimo (tablature) and MuseScore (CMN), convert the files to MEI and finalise them using [_mei-friend_](https://mei-friend.github.io) (Werner Goebl, David M. Weigl) to all required files. As the diagram shows, we co-operate with other developers, e.g. [_Luteconv_](https://luteconv.mdw.ac.at) (Paul Overell, E-LAUTE team), and at the same time create our own tools (_TabMEI_transcriber_; _AbsoLutely Tabulous_) (both Reinier de Valk).

- We create **literal transcriptions in a project-specific reduced variant of CMN** that is in accordance with the tablature notation, consisting of one or two staves containing only stemless, black noteheads and rhythm flags (placed above the staff — as in the
tablature), in order to provide only pitch information (also automatically changeable) and avoid suggestions of duration and voice-leading (i.e., of polyphonic structure).
