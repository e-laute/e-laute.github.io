Within the series of the _Denkmäler der Tonkunst in Österreich (DTÖ)_
a hybrid edition of several of the sources will be published. The printed volume will consist of the
diplomatic transcription of the original tablatures and the edition in common music notation (=CMN) with a short scholarly
introduction and a short critical report. Cross-references will be given to corresponding online
editions using URLs. Only the online edition will present the originals (facsimile), transcriptions of
the original tablatures into different tablature notations, concordance lists and the possibilities to
compare concordances from different sources, as well as other scholarly texts. The planned volume
will contain: A-Wn Mus.Hs. 18827, A-Wn Mus.Hs. 18688, PL-WRk 352, A-Wn Cod. 9704, A-Wn Cod. 960, A-Lis 546
= c. 200 fols. (c. 300 pages, A4). The work will be carried out in cooperation with Prof Dr Birgit Lodes
(leader of the publications of the _DTÖ_) and with consultations from the editorial board of the _DTÖ_.
This study introduces a new format to the _DTÖ_ series, which ensures the regular output and
presentation of our results. It will thus reach an even wider target audience. If this format is
successful, we will try to extend it to other holdings and thus develop the connection with 'Denkmäler’
series. The research questions posed here concern international connectivity of selected 'Austrian
sources' at all levels of our entire E-LAUTE edition.
